* **Continuous Learner:** Currently deepening my knowledge in **.NET** and **Modern Frontend (React)** to better understand the full development lifecycle.


### 🤝 Engineering Values

I believe that a successful project is built on three pillars:
1)  **Trust**
2)  **Professionalism**
3)  **Iterative Growth**
